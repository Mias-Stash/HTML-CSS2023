                Birds of paradise, many of which were shown in the video above, aren’t a single species of bird- rather a name for a wide variety of birds hailing from around New Guinea and Indonesia. 
                First taxonomically described around 1825 by the naturalist William Swainson, they quickly became world renowned and poached for their feathers to be used in the feather trade. 
                Their vibrant, varied feathers were very popular as centerpieces for hats and accessories, or just to be collected. 
                As the craze eventually fizzled out, more and more people became aware of the state of the birds’ population numbers, and began looking for ways to conserve the beautiful birds. 
                As of modern times, deforestation is the primary threat to these birds, rather than hunting.

                This family of birds has 45 unique species, and 17 genera! (Think of genera as branches on the family tree.) 
                The most well-known of the family is likely the Greater Bird of Paradise- it even has a type of flower named after it, though said plant is also known as the crane flower. 
                Referring back to the video, this family is not only known for their fantastic plumage, but their strange and unique mating displays. 
                Males of these birds come in all shapes, colors, and sizes to impress mates. 
                They make use of all sorts of outlandish calls, dances, and many other intricacies for this task- as the females can tend to be quite picky!
