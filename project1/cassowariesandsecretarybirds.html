                The image above is of a cassowary- a type of ratite- part of the same family of birds as ostriches, kiwis, and emus! (among other birds) 
                Their call is low and rumbling, almost like machinery. 
                The large protrusion on its head is made of bone, and most experts believe it to amplify the volume of their calls! 
                When standing at their full height, they can look down on a 5’5” person, and the middle claws on their feet can reach lengths of up to 5 inches! 
                Their wings also sport a nifty little surprise- a claw as well! 
                As one can probably guess, these large fellows are extremely dangerous! It’s best to admire these birds from afar.

                Secretary birds (pictured above) are endemic from the middle to south of the continent of Africa. 
                They mostly populate grasslands and savannas. 
                Standing over four feet tall, lower grass is usually their preferred zone of habitation, so they can be on the lookout for predators. 
                They are one of two remaining types of land-hunting birds of prey, along side the Crested Caracara, which hails from middle to south America. 
                Secretary birds are mostly known for their hunting strategy- kicking their prey into submission. 
                Their most famous prey- or enemy- are the numerous snakes that stalk the savannas of Africa, including the venomous ones!
