            <h2>An Introduction, and some Information on this Page</h2>
            <p>
                Hey there! Welcome to my first website project. 
                Navigating this page and the links provided, you’ll find a few different types of birds I would put among my personal favorites. 
                I’d like to show them to you today! 
                Within these pages, you’ll find ratites, birds of prey, and birds of paradise. 
                This website makes use of three different media types, mp3 sound files, jpg image files, and youtube/mp4 video files.
                Each page will contain some general information on each type of bird showcased, about a paragraph or two for each one, along with a few lesser-known, but still fun, facts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along side being a showcase for some of my personal favorite birds, this website will serve as a testing ground for some basic CSS coding. 
                My aim is to make this website dyslexia-friendly, and easy on the eyes for visual users, along with being accessible to screen-readers should that be the case of usage. 
                The tan backgrounds and dark blues should hopefully provide good, easy-on-the eyes contrast to maximize readability while retaining visual identity.
                I hope the experience of navigating and viewing this website is all around pleasant and without any kind of hitches! 
                Thank you so much for visiting and viewing, and I hope you learn something new!
