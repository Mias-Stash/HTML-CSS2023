                Pretty chilling sound, right? I bet it sounds familiar, too! 
                The loon’s call has been used in cinema for many years now, particularly in spooky scenes. 
                It’s great as an atmospheric sound to introduce audiences to a wild, usually forest-y environment. 
                The trademark “woo-ooh” variation of their call is the most commonly used in media. 
                While the loon’s call is usually used in forest scenes, they are actually water birds! 
                By water birds I don’t mean waterfowl like ducks, either. 
                Loons are their own genus of birds, entirely separate from ducks! 
                They dive to catch prey, similar to ducks, though.

                Common loons live throughout most of the United States and Canada. 
                Almost exclusively found in or on water, they come ashore to breed and rear their young on the shores of freshwater lakes. 
                They are larger than most ducks, but hunt in a similar manner to them, ambushing aquatic prey from above. 
                Due to their mostly water-based lifestyle, their body plan is fairly different to ducks, as well. 
                Their legs are situated much further back on their bodies than ducks, which can make land locomotion difficult. 
                The picture above is of their spring and summer plumage. In the winter, common loons are usually gray with a white belly and throat.
