									<h3>An Introduction, and some Information on this Site</h3>
									<p>Along side being a showcase for some of my personal favorite birds, this website will serve as a testing ground for some basic CSS and JavaScript coding. 
									My aim is to make this website dyslexia-friendly, and easy on the eyes for visual users, along with being accessible to screen-readers should that be the case of usage. 
									The pink background and white sectioning, along with lite-font text should hopefully provide good, easy-on-the eyes contrast to maximize readability while retaining visual identity.
									I hope the experience of navigating and viewing this website is all around pleasant and without any kind of hitches! 
									Thank you so much for visiting and viewing, and I hope you learn something new!</p>

								<p>The image above is of a cassowary- a type of ratite- part of the same family of birds as ostriches, kiwis, and emus! (among other birds) 
								Their call is low and rumbling, almost like machinery. 
								The large protrusion on its head is made of bone, and most experts believe it to amplify the volume of their calls! 
								When standing at their full height, they can look down on a 5’5” person, and the middle claws on their feet can reach lengths of up to 5 inches! 
								Their wings also sport a nifty little surprise- a claw as well! 
								As one can probably guess, these large fellows are extremely dangerous! It’s best to admire these birds from afar.

								<p>Secretary birds (pictured above) are endemic from the middle to south of the continent of Africa. 
								They mostly populate grasslands and savannas. 
								Standing over four feet tall, lower grass is usually their preferred zone of habitation, so they can be on the lookout for predators. 
								They are one of two remaining types of land-hunting birds of prey, along side the Crested Caracara, which hails from middle to south America. 
								Secretary birds are mostly known for their hunting strategy- kicking their prey into submission. 
								Their most famous prey- or enemy- are the numerous snakes that stalk the savannas of Africa, including the venomous ones!

							<p>Pretty chilling sound, right? I bet it sounds familiar, too! 
							The loon’s call has been used in cinema for many years now, particularly in spooky scenes. 
							It’s great as an atmospheric sound to introduce audiences to a wild, usually forest-y environment. 
							The trademark “woo-ooh” variation of their call is the most commonly used in media. 
							While the loon’s call is usually used in forest scenes, they are actually water birds! 
							By water birds I don’t mean waterfowl like ducks, either. 
							Loons are their own genus of birds, entirely separate from ducks! 
							They dive to catch prey, similar to ducks, though.

							<p>Common loons live throughout most of the United States and Canada. 
							Almost exclusively found in or on water, they come ashore to breed and rear their young on the shores of freshwater lakes. 
							They are larger than most ducks, but hunt in a similar manner to them, ambushing aquatic prey from above. 
							Due to their mostly water-based lifestyle, their body plan is fairly different to ducks, as well. 
							Their legs are situated much further back on their bodies than ducks, which can make land locomotion difficult. 
							The picture above is of their spring and summer plumage. In the winter, common loons are usually gray with a white belly and throat.

								<h2>Birds of Paradise</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Birds of paradise, many of which were shown in the video above, aren’t a single species of bird- rather a name for a wide variety of birds hailing from around New Guinea and Indonesia. 
            	    		First taxonomically described around 1825 by the naturalist William Swainson, they quickly became world renowned and poached for their feathers to be used in the feather trade. 
            		    	Their vibrant, varied feathers were very popular as centerpieces for hats and accessories, or just to be collected. 
            				As the craze eventually fizzled out, more and more people became aware of the state of the birds’ population numbers, and began looking for ways to conserve the beautiful birds. 
            		    	As of modern times, deforestation is the primary threat to these birds, rather than hunting.

							<p>This family of birds has 45 unique species, and 17 genera! (Think of genera as branches on the family tree.) 
								The most well-known of the family is likely the Greater Bird of Paradise- it even has a type of flower named after it, though said plant is also known as the crane flower. 
								Referring back to the video, this family is not only known for their fantastic plumage, but their strange and unique mating displays. 
								Males of these birds come in all shapes, colors, and sizes to impress mates. 
								They make use of all sorts of outlandish calls, dances, and many other intricacies for this task- as the females can tend to be quite picky!
