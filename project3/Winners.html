										A really lovely picture all around- it brings to mind Arthurian legends of the sword in the lake. On 11/20/2023, this image of a misty lake in a fall time forest won the vote of the images it was paired against. It was pitted against a dynamic image of a bull charging a matador, and an image of a full English breakfast taken from a scenic ocean view. The focus of this picture is much more obscured than the other two, a very atmospheric and contemplative piece. The haze of the background blending into a white fog obscuring the horizon really draws the viewer in. Credits for the image go to Unsplash and Evgeni Tcherkasski.

											My personal favorite- who doesn’t love sick bird pics? On 10/14/2023, this image of a hawk won the vote of the images it was paired against. It was pitted against an image of Tahquamenon Falls in Autumn, and an image of a dim-sum set from a restaurant in New York. This round was a tough one! Delicious food vs. wonderful sights vs. amazing animals. The composition on this photo in particular really stood out among the others, its focus was much more clearly defined. Ultimately, it was a slim vote, but the little hawk that could soared past the finish line to end up here! Credits for the image go to Unsplash and Bob Brewer.

											On 8/22/2023, this food photo won the vote of the images it was paired against. It was pitted against a photo of a pair of giraffes by a wet-season pond, and a photo of Mt. Rainier at nighttime. A rather innocuous image, if you ask me. I like its use of color balance and contrast, though. The bright yellow background really makes it POP! I would imagine this is what led to it standing out among the other two. Plus, who doesn’t instantly get hungry at a big heaping bowl of noodles, meat, and veggies? Credits for the image go to Unsplash and Kawê Rodrigues.

										<h3>So how were these winners chosen?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Short answer! They weren't. (This is why the dates don't match up with the sources!) This webpage is purely for demonstration purposes.
										If I were to keep it up, however, I would be updating it with the proper winners of each vote.
