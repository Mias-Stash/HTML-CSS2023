							<h2>It's all About Photographs!</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Welcome to my third (and final) project page of the semester! This one is all about photography. It includes a few buttons to share this website, along with a link to contact me via Email. It has much more to offer though, including a rules page with live chat and image submission, a voting section, and a gallery of previously voted winners!
						This website be a final test of my skills learned in this course, I will also be making use of meta tags and XML sitemaps, which were introduced in the latest module of class.
						With all of that being said, please enjoy, and don’t forget to leave feedback!

									<h3>Landscapes/Nature</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Anything from valleys, to rivers, to mountains, to forests, to caves, to reefs, to trenches and beyond. Any kind of non-animal focused nature pictures are welcome and encouraged here! Found a really interesting picture of a weird mushroom? Send it on over and I’ll put it up on the poll! Come across a particularly strange fairy ring while walking around? Don’t step in it- snap a pic and toss it my way! Even the inconspicuous things are game. Cool tree that catches the light just right? Perfect! It’s all about enjoying the minute beauties of the world around us, and what better place to start than somewhere big? Credits for the image go to Unsplash and Bob Brewer.

									<h3>Wildlife/Animals</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Just like flora and fungi, all types of fauna are welcome to be submitted for voting here! Saw two bugs fighting on the sidewalk? Time a photo right and you might just win the vote! Got a particularly haunting and harrowing image of a deer you saw on a trail cam? I’d love to see it! Found the absolute most majestic image of a crane you think will ever be possible to take and view with human eyes? Well you might as well make sure that more people see it! Credits for the image go to Unsplash and Elliot Voilmy.

									<h3>Food/Drink</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Speaking of flora, fauna, and fungi, food (and drinks) are an absolute must here! Family dinner, fancy lunch, casual brunch, dive bar drinks, cheap breakfast? Any and all of it has a home right here! The only requirements are good focus, good lighting, and good looking food! Found a new Thai place with the best looking Tom Kha you’ve ever seen? I’d love to see it too! Tried some biryani on a whim and came back the next day for the presentation? I’ve been there- make sure you show me as well! Who knows, maybe your next meal will win the vote! Credits for the image go to Unsplash and Alexandra Tran.
